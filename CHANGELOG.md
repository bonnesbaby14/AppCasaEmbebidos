### Features  ‚ú®
- Colors:
  - `selectedColor` is the color set on the current index. Default is `Colors.blue`
  - `disabledColor` is the color if the TextField is disabled. Default is `Colors.grey`
- Optional `focusNode` can be passed to the constructor to manage it from outside.
  - Added a listener to the focusNode which triggers a rebuild on every change so it'll reflect the correct color on each pin.
- Added a new constructor parameter called `enabled`. Default is true
- Added an optional constructor parameter: `void Function(String) onCompleted`. which triggers when all fields are filled.

### Fixes  üêõ
- Colors:
  - `activeColor` and `inactiveColor` were swapped
- Keyboard does not show up onTap #4
